<p>Here are a few reviews from several customers&hellip;..</p>
<p>&quot;I've worked with Dave for&nbsp;5 years and his professionalism and sophistication has been a constant.&nbsp;We've worked with many electricians and contractors over the years,&nbsp;but Dave goes beyond his job as an electrician&nbsp;and installer;&nbsp;he functions as an expert in the trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what makes him such a great partner to our firm -- our clients truly enjoy having him around.&nbsp; Dave is not just another trade contractor, he has become a friend and a trusted advisor. Thanks Dave!&quot;</p>

&quot;I was referred to Dave by Wilson Lighting. After undergoing a messy kitchen remodel last year, I was pleasantly surprised when Dave's team arrived on time and was respectful of my property. I needed a chandelier switched-out in the kitchen, two pendant lights installed and some issues from a lightening strike so four canned lights had to be replaced. Not only did they flawlessly install the lights, they even made sure that I had medallions to go with the pendant lights! It was obvious they knew what they were doing, and what I appreciated most was their cleanliness and accommodation to my schedule. They did what I asked them to do and they didn&rsquo;t make a mess or break anything. Overall I was impressed with the whole job --I would refer them to everybody.&quot;

&quot;Dave and his team helped us with our kitchen remodel and family room update. He added outlets, canned lighting, under cabinet lighting, ran new wiring for our electric range and added ceiling lights above our fireplace. Before we started the project, we spent time discussing our needs and Dave was not only receptive but he also offered other suggestions and options that we hadn't thought of (like the under cabinet lighting). They did a super job with the installation and they were very contentious of our house and mindful of our surroundings. The entire team did a good job of explaining things and keeping us in the loop. We knew what we were getting with each step. Dave is an honest, good businessman and you can tell he wants his customers to be happy.&quot;

&quot;We use Dave on a variety of small to mid-size projects ranging from remodels to new additions. We like using Dave and his team because he has an orderly approach to his work. He meets with our homeowners and lays out a general plan and concept for his lighting installation. What we're most impressed with his is issues' resolution skills. If there is a problem with a light &ndash; or any part of his job - he immediately does what it takes to fix the problem. Dave is a super nice guy, very respectful of our space, professional and provides us with quality work. He is not your stereotypical electrician.&quot;
